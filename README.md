# Clinify Squad's SleepBot

Official Bot for the Clinify.in Discord Server written in Python using Discord.py

Though this bot is intended to be used only on the Clinify.in Discord Server, you can self host it in your server to test it out. Installation guide down below.

## Dependancies

This bot requires the [Discord.py v1.5+ library](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/), [pretty-help 1.1.2](https://pypi.org/project/discord-pretty-help/), [discord-py-slash-command 1.1.0](https://pypi.org/project/discord-py-slash-command/) and [dpymenus 1.2](https://pypi.org/project/dpymenus/) which can be installed using pip package manager.

## How to host the bot

1. Edit the i-channel_table.txt file in SQL_CMDS folder as required.
2. Run the SQLite3_Py.py script to make the database file.
3. Create a .env file in the same directory as Main.py and enter your Discord Bot Token like this:

```py
DISCORD_TOKEN=Your Token Here
```

4. Run Main.py to start the bot!

## Note

This bot requires Server Members Intent so make sure to enable that by going to your Discord Application -> Bot -> Privilaged Gateway Intents and enabling Server Members Intent. Without this, bot won't be able to access the cache to get user names.
